# Parallel-plate-channel
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Analysis of Parallel Plate Channel
Consider a parallel plate channel with length L=10.472 H, width B=3.04H, Height is H=1.0.
Please refer to the figure below. The channel can be divided into number of rectangular
cells. The top wall and the bottom walls are solid no-slip walls, the side walls are free slip
walls.
